Gals that Code is a way to learn coding through fun tasks using python for the most part.

## set up

1. Virtual Enviroment

For every challenge create virtual environment to keep things tidy. 

Here is how you do it:

a. Open your terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the folder where you want to store the project.

b. Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

bash
```
python -m venv [task-identifier]_env
```

c. Activate the virtual environment:

```
[task-identifier]_env\Scripts\activate
```

d. Once the environment is active, you'll see `[task-identifier]_env` at the start of your terminal prompt.

2. Install Required Packages: 

As you are developing you will find that you need to install certain libraries. You can do this by running:

```
python -m pip install [library name]
```

You can also add all your requirements to a requirements.txt file and run the following to install all at once:

```
python -m pip install -r [relative/path/to/requirements.txt]
```

3. Create a Python File: 

Inside the Task folder, create a Python file to write your task program as `[task-identifier].py`
